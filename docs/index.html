        <h2>I Introduce to You.... Chopped Caesar Salad Wraps</h2>
        <h2>What You'll Need</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>1 heart of romaine</li>
        <li>Precooked grilled chicken</li>
        <li>Caesar dressing</li>
        <li>1/2 cupe of parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>Croutons</li>
        <li>Sourdough</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>How To Make</h2>
        <p>To make chopped caesar salad sandwiches, start by adding one chopped heart of romaine to a cutting board.</p>
        <p>Next, add one pound of cooked chicken on top of the lettuce. For this recipe, grilled chicken, but any cooked chicken can work!</p>
        <p>Add croutons ontop of the chicken and lettuce for the perfect crunch. Give everything a good chop!</p>
        <p>After chopping everything into pieces, place it all into a mixing bowl. Then, add shredded parmesean cheese and your preferred amount of dressing. Mix, mix, mix!</p>
        <p>Once everything is mixed, it's time to build the sandwiches! Grab your sourdough; although, any preferred bread will work! Place the mixture onto the bread.</p>
        <p>Lastly, add any preferred sides you may like. I usually like to add a side of fruit and some chips! And there you go!!! You're own caesar salad sandwhiches!</p>
        <p>Once you try it, you'll be hooked!</p>
