        <p>My name is Erin Kelly, and I am a Senior at the University of Pittsburgh. Over the last 4 years I have developed my favorite meals that are easy, cost-effective, healthy, and enjoyable. On this website, I want to present them to the world of college students—or really anyone—who’s looking for the right meals for them!</p>
